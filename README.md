## Complementary Expressions Method for Approximating e

The complementary expressions method leverages two complementary limits that converge to e and 1/e respectively.

### Method Overview

1. **Expression for e**:
   (n+1/n)^n
   This expression approaches e as n increases. It is based on the limit definition of e from calculus:
   e = lim[n→∞] (1 + 1/n)^n
   By manipulating the expression slightly, it becomes:
   (n+1/n)^n = (1 + 1/n)^n

2. **Expression for 1/e**:
   (n-1/n)^n
   This expression converges to 1/e as n increases. The reciprocal of this value provides another approximation of e.

### Calculation Steps

1. **Calculate (n+1/n)^n**: Compute this expression for a given n. This value directly approximates e.

2. **Calculate (n-1/n)^n**: Compute this expression for the same n and then take its reciprocal to get another approximation of e:
   1 / ((n-1/n)^n)

3. **Compare the Two Approximations**: Both approximations should be very close to the true value of e. But the difference between them is even closer, specifically when truncating the leading zeros.

### Step-by-Step Calculation for Example n = 100,000

1. **Calculate (100,001/100,000)^100,000**:

   (accurate to 6th decimal place)

2. **Calculate (99,999/100,000)^100,000**:
   (99,999/100,000)^100,000
   The reciprocal is:
   1 / ((99,999/100,000)^100,000) ≈ 2.718295419992776636984018555252864677526093772741773601919706552377623091327243183538793488615641215
   (accurate to 6th decimal place)

3. **Difference between the Two Approximations**:
   (100,001/100,000)^100,000 - 1/((99,999/100,000)^100,000) = -0.000027182818286968948953730826818229551646840063950738910542132532471286989225867449654084778689732

   When you truncate the 0s and add a decimal after the first non-zero term, you get
   2.7182818286968948953730826818229551646840063950738910542132532471286989225867449654084778689732
   Which is accurate to the 11th decimal place!

As n approaches infinity, the difference between the approximations (1 + 1/n)^n and 1/((1 - 1/n)^n) converges to e. The error term associated with this convergence can be approximated by:
E(n) = |(1 + 1/n)^n - 1/((1 - 1/n)^n) - (e - 1/e)|

I believe that the error term E(n) can be approximated by:
E(n) ≈ 2.38 × 10^(-2x - 1)
where x = log_10(n). Thus, as n increases by an order of magnitude, the error term decreases by approximately two orders of magnitude. This relationship can also be expressed as:
E(n) ≈ (7e/8) · 10^(-2x)
