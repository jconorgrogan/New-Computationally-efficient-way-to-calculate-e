# New-Computationally-efficient-way-to-calculate-e

Found an interesting way to calculate e which seems incredibly accurate as well as extremely computationally efficient. Haven't seen this discussed anywhere. 

## Complementary Expressions Method for Approximating \( e \)

The complementary expressions method leverages two complementary limits that converge to \( e \) and \( \frac{1}{e} \) respectively. This approach uses these limits to achieve a fast and accurate approximation of \( e \).

### Method Overview

1. **Expression for \( e \)**:
   \[
   \left(\frac{n+1}{n}\right)^n
   \]
   This expression approaches \( e \) as \( n \) increases. It is based on the limit definition of \( e \) from calculus:
   \[
   e = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n
   \]
   By manipulating the expression slightly, it becomes:
   \[
   \left(\frac{n+1}{n}\right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n
   \]

2. **Expression for \( \frac{1}{e} \)**:
   \[
   \left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)^n
   \]
   This expression converges to \( \frac{1}{e} \) as \( n \) increases. The reciprocal of this value provides another approximation of \( e \).

### Calculation Steps

1. **Calculate \( \left(\frac{n+1}{n}\right)^n \)**:
   Compute this expression for a given \( n \). This value directly approximates \( e \).

2. **Calculate \( \left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)^n \)**:
   Compute this expression for the same \( n \) and then take its reciprocal to get another approximation of \( e \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{\left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)^n}
   \]

3. **Compare the Two Approximations**:
   Both approximations should be very close to the true value of \( e \). By analyzing the convergence properties of these two expressions, you can verify the accuracy of the approximation.
